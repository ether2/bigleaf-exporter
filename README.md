# bigleaf-exporter
Prometheus exporter for BigleafÂ® Networks status api

NOTE: This is not an official Bigleaf product. It is simply a personal/independent project to leverage Prometheus for purposes of observability and visualization of Bigleaf devices on a Grafana dashboard.

This container calls the Bigleaf status API and returns information across all sites and all circuits. It exposes prometheus metrics at http://localhost:8000/metrics

# Supported Metrics

bigleaf_circuit_status

bigleaf_circuit_severity

bigleaf_site_status

bigleaf_response_time

bigleaf_http_status
